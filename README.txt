README.txt for Assignment 1

1. To my knowledge, all of my work has been correctly implemented with the given instructions. 

2. See List of Files with Comments Citing Source of Help Below

3. Roughly 10 hours, a lot of Googling and searching Piazza for syntax-type questions. Very unfamiliar with using stackoverflow, html, css, so I am sure "simple" problems for some took me extra time just due to ignorance. Got much faster as the assignment went on!!!!
