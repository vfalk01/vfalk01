	<h1> A Short Biography of Vincent Manuel Falk </h1>
		<p> If you spend at least 5 minutes with Vincent Manuel Falk, you will understand two things: his love for his family and his love for Chicago. Vince was born to Paul and Roxane Falk at McNeil Hospital in Chicago, just a few miles away from where his mother grew up. After his birth, his family moved only a few miles away from his mother's childhood neighborhood to the small town of Riverside, Illinois. His brother Nick, 4 years older, and sister Raquel, 3 years older, played a large role in Vince's upbringing. Aside from his close siblings, Vince grew up with a tight-knit group of 7 cousins. This was easy because all of his cousins grew up only about a half hour away from Riverside in a suburb called Orland Park. Vince's closest cousin and best friend Luke was born only weeks him. </p>
		<p> Growing up in Riverside, Vince fell in love with sports. It did not matter if it was swimming, soccer, basketball, baseball, or his favorite sport, football, Vince loved all aspects of competition and activity. His most influential team by far was his St. Mary's youth football team. Ironically, the St. Mary's mascot was the Demons (now changed to the Spartans for obvious reasons). Vince quickly made friends he would have for the rest of his life, while learning valuable lessons of hard work and discipline at an early age. After his grade school years, Vince continued to play football for a private, catholic high school called Fenwick High School. Vince met more life-long friends and brought his competitive nature into the classroom, excelling in math and science and being a member of the National Honors Society. With the formation from an elite highschool, Vince was able to get into Tufts University to continue his love for football and math/science by becoming an engineer as well. Vince continues to display his passion for football and competitive nature to this day, where he is expected to graduate with a Bachelor of Science in Human Factors Engineering. Though his football career may end after this season, Vince will always cherish the lessons learned and skills acquired from being a student athlete his entire life.</p>
